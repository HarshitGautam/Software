comment: Note that although the many U12-type introns have the sequence AT-AC at the intron termini, some introns with these terminal sequences are spliced by the U2-type spliceosome. The distinguishing characteristics are sequences near the 5' splice site and the branch point sequences of the intron.

[GOC:txnOH, PMID:16858867]
comment: Note that some basal transcription factors are themselves considered to have coactivator activity, in that they mediate interactions between an activator and either RNA polymerase II itself or another basal transcription factor.

comment: In E. coli, the first step of the reaction is reductive elimination of sulfur from L-cysteine by IscS cysteine desulfurase to form an enzyme-bound cysteine-persulfide intermediate. Then, five essential gene products, TusA, TusB, TusC, TusD and TusE, mediate a sulfur relay that delivers the terminal sulfur of persulfide from IscS to MnmA12. The last protein, MnmA catalyzes the transfer of the sulfur from IscS to an ATP activated U34 of the tRNA.

def: "Translational attenuation is a regulatory mechanism analogous to ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation. The system requires the presence of a short ORF, called a leader peptide, encoded in the mRNA upstream of the ribosome-binding site and start codon of the gene whose translation is to be regulated. Certain conditions, such as presence of the antibiotic tetracycline in bacteria or amino acid starvation, may cause slowing or stalling of the ribosome translating the leader peptide. The stalled ribosome masks a region of the mRNA and affects which of two alternative mRNA folded structures will form, therefore controlling whether or not a ribosome will bind and initiate translation of the downstream gene. Translational attenuation is analogous to ribosome-mediated transcriptional attenuation, in which mRNA remodeling caused by ribosome stalling regulates transcriptional termination rather than translational initiation."

name: transcriptional attenuation by ribosome
namespace: biological_process
def: "A type of transcriptional regulation at the level of early termination. This process can occur only in prokaryotes, where transcription of an operon into messenger RNA and translation of that mRNA into polypeptides occur simultaneously. The general principle is that alternative mRNA secondary structures occur under different physiological conditions such as available amount of a particular amino acid. One set of conditions favors early termination of transcription. In the classic example of the trp biosynthesis operon, translation of the gene for a short, trp-containing polypeptide called the trp operon leader peptide pauses either at a trp codon (if tryptophan is scarce) or the stop codon (if trp is readily available). In the former situation transcription continues, but in the latter a Rho-independent terminator forms and reduces, or attenuates, expression of the tryptophan biosynthesis genes. Although the polypeptides encoded by leader peptide genes appear not to be stable once their translation is complete, it is suggested by recent studies that their nascent polypeptide chains interact specifically with ribosomes, specific uncharged tRNAs, or other cellular components to inhibit release at the stop codon and improve the function of transcriptional attenuation as a regulatory switch."

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted as homodimers, non-covalently associated with N-terminal pro-peptides, and are targeted to the extracellular matrix through interaction with matrix proteins." [GOC:BHF, PMID:20855508]
comment: Confining BMP in the extracellular matrix may be achieved by binding BMP directly, or by binding to members of a BMP-containing complex.

def: "Any process in which a virus stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression in the host organism. Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA into protein. Some protein processing events may be included when they are required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form." [UniProtKB-KW:KW-1190, VZ:1582]

It is generally still observed in the middle of genes, overlapping with phosphorylation of serine 2, but is generally not present at the 3' ends of genes. In vivo, Ser5 phosphorylation occurs primarily through the action of TFIIH (KIN28 in S. cerevisiae, CKD7 in metazoans)." [GOC:krc, PMID:17079683]

CAAX box proteins are eukaryotic proteins that contain a CAAX motif where the C is a cysteine, the two A residues are aliphatic amino acids and the X can be one of several amino acids. The CAAX-box proteins undergo three sequential, enzymatic, post-translational modifications essential to their targeting: First, the proteins are prenylated by one of two prenyltransferases called farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase-I. Prenylation results in the covalent attachment of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid groups to the cysteine in the CAAX box motif. Prenylation is followed by proteolytic removal of the last three amino acids of the protein (AAX). Finally, the newly exposed carboxylate group of the isoprenylcysteine is methylated by an ER-associated prenyl-dependent carboxylmethyltransferase." [PMID:12039957, PMID:17114793, PMID:18641086]

def: "An amino acid chain that is produced de novo by ribosome-mediated translation of a genetically-encoded mRNA." [PRO:DAN, PRO:WCB]
comment: Proteins descended from a common ancestor can be classified into families and superfamilies composed of products of evolutionarily-related genes. The domain architecture of a protein is described by the order of its constituent domains. Proteins with the same domains in the same order are defined as homeomorphic [PRO:WCB].

comment: Comment: An instance of Site [snap:Site] is a mixture of independent continuant [snap:IndependentContinuant] entities which act as surrounding environments for other independent continuant [snap:IndependentContinuant] entities, most importantly for instances of object [snap:Object]. A site [snap:Site] is typically made of object [snap:Object] or fiat object part [snap:FiatObjectPart] entities and a surrounding medium in which is found an object [snap:Object] occupying the site [snap:Site]. Independent continuant [snap:IndependentContinuant] entities may be associated with others (which, then, are site [snap:Site] entities) through a relation of "occupation". That relation is connected to, but distinct from, the relation of spatial location. Site [snap:Site] entities are not to be confused with spatial region [snap:SpatialRegion] entities. In BFO, site [snap:Site] allows for a so-called relational view of space which is different from the view corresponding to the class spatial region [snap:SpatialRegion] (see the comment on this class).

The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is complementary with the upstream leader portion of RpoS messenger RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the RpoS message might be important for translational regulation."

comment: Note that adjacent_to as thus defined is not a symmetric relation, in contrast to its instance-level counterpart. For it can be the case that Cs are in general such as to be adjacent to instances of C1 while no analogous statement holds for C1s in general in relation to instances of C.

comment: Containment obtains in each case between material and immaterial continuants, for instance: lung contained_in thoracic cavity; bladder contained_in pelvic cavity. Hence containment is not a transitive relation.    If c part_of c1 at t then we have also, by our definition and by the axioms of mereology applied to spatial regions, c located_in c1 at t. Thus, many examples of instance-level location relations for continuants are in fact cases of instance-level parthood. For material continuants location and parthood coincide. Containment is location not involving parthood, and arises only where some immaterial continuant is involved. To understand this relation, we first define overlap for continuants as follows:    c1 overlap c2 at t =def for some c, c part_of c1 at t and c part_of c2 at t. The containment relation on the instance level can then be defined (see definition):

comment: Has_participant is a primitive instance-level relation between a process, a continuant, and a time at which the continuant participates in some way in the process.

comment: OBSOLETE. The definition is "As for part_of, with the additional constraint that subject and object may be identical". However, part_of is already reflexive, therefore improper_part_of is identical to part_of. If read differently, as "improper_part_of is part_of but not proper_part_of",improper_part_of becomes identity. So, improper_part_of is either identical to part_of or to identity, and not an intuitive synonym for either of them. [Robert Hoehndorf]

comment: Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus

For processes: P part_of P' if and only if: given any p that instantiates P at a time t, there is some p' such that p' instantiates P' at time t, and p *part_of* p' at t.

comment: Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception.    This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.    For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t.    Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.

comment: An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.

comment: When an embryonic oenocyte (a type of insect cell) is transformed into a larval oenocyte, one and the same continuant entity preserves its identity while instantiating distinct classes at distinct times. The class-level relation transformation_of obtains between continuant classes C and C1 wherever each instance of the class C is such as to have existed at some earlier time as an instance of the distinct class C1 (see Figure 2 in paper). This relation is illustrated first of all at the molecular level of granularity by the relation between mature RNA and the pre-RNA from which it is processed, or between (UV-induced) thymine-dimer and thymine dinucleotide. At coarser levels of granularity it is illustrated by the transformations involved in the creation of red blood cells, for example, from reticulocyte to erythrocyte, and by processes of development, for example, from larva to pupa, or from (post-gastrular) embryo to fetus or from child to adult. It is also manifest in pathological transformations, for example, of normal colon into carcinomatous colon. In each such case, one and the same continuant entity instantiates distinct classes at different times in virtue of phenotypic changes.

comment: This relation is currently used to connect two regulation processes p1 and p2, such that if r1 regulates p1 and r2 regulates p2, and r1 results_in r2 then the regulation of p1 is required for the regulation of p2. For an example of use, see GO:0035958 'regulation of glyoxylate cycle by regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter'. Note that a precise definition of this relation is under discussion. After it has been formalized it will be added to RO, where it will have a RO ID. Note that the existing identifier and label are subject to change.
